# Keep Web Font Size Under 300kb

Web fonts are a great way to add style to your website. However, they can also be a major performance bottleneck. The more fonts you use, the more time it takes for the browser to download and render the page. This can lead to a poor user experience and a high bounce rate.

Webfont sizes shouldn’t exceed 300kb (all variants included) and are optimized for performance.
